//HOW TO USE THIS ASSET//
/////////////////////////

Hello! Thank you for downloading the Super Pixel Objects and Items collection. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- In the root folder, you will find a folder named PNG. This folder contains all the objects and items as descriptively-named PNGs, separated into folders.

- In any of the object / item folders, you will find folders separating the assets by outline. Please note that not all assets have all outline styles!

	- default (RECOMMENDED FOR ANY ASSET)
		The default folder contains the assets with no outline. They will not extend out of a 32x32 boundary (or 16x16 boundary for smaller assets).

	- outline_black_inside (RECOMMENDED FOR STRICT BOUNDARY REQUIREMENTS)
		This folder contains the assets with a near-black outline that is typically overlaid on the outermost pixels of the object. They will not extend out of a 32x32 boundary (or 16x16 boundary for smaller assets).

	- outline_white_inside (RECOMMENDED FOR STRICT BOUNDARY REQUIREMENTS AND COLLECTIBLES)
		Same as above, but white outline. It looks really good on the gems, coins, and other collectibles.

	- outline_black_outside (RECOMMENDED FOR ANY ASSET)
		This folder contains the assets with a near-black outline that is typically not overlaid on any pixels of the object. It may extend slightly out of the boundaries of the original object, but it also generally looks better in my opinion.

	- outline_white_outside (RECOMMENDED FOR COLLECTIBLES)
		Same as above, but white outline. It looks really good on the gems, coins, and other collectibles.

- In the root folder, you will also find a folder named spritesheet. This folder contains the master spritesheet, and two choices of metadata format for reading the spritesheet. (Pick the format you like!)

- You'll notice that some assets have animation! Animation is indicated by filenames like "frame0000.png", "frame0001.png", and so on.
	- The recommended frame duration for most animations is 0.05 seconds per frame (20 FPS).
	- Bombs and dynamite only have 2 frames of animation, so consider going down to 10 or 5 FPS.
	- For the spring animation, I recommend:
		- Frames 0-3 = 0.1 seconds each (10 FPS)
		- Frame 4 = 0.2 seconds (5 FPS)
		- Frames 5-7 = 0.05 seconds each (20 FPS)
		Alternatively, 20 FPS over the whole thing works too... Whatever floats your boat!
	- NOTE: The sparkle animations contain blank frames for timing purposes. Feel free to remove them or adjust them.
